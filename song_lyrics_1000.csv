December 4th,rap,JAY-Z,2003.0,283714.0,{},"   Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.   They say ""They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone."" So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long But at least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves Who made love under the sycamore tree Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain Although through the years I gave her her fair share I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted Hold on  Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.   Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me And my momma couldn't beat me Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me So, with that disdain in my membrane Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came Then DeHaven introduced me to the game Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap But that came second to me movin' this crack ""Gimme a second, I swear,"" I would say about my rap career 'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!   Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.   Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up And the drought will define a man when the well dries up You learn the worth of water without work You thirst 'til you die, yup! And niggas get tied up for product And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up To show mothers they really got 'em And this was the stress I lived with 'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven For every bad decision I made, every sister I played ‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me  If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade...",15.0

Bomb First My Second Reply,rap,2Pac,1996.0,292135.0,{Outlawz}," In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli."" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:   It's not about East or West It's about niggas and bitches Power and money, ridaz and punks Which side are you on? *Heartbeat* *Gunshots* *Encroaching footsteps* These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'? You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches A'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don) Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass) (Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!

for And some say Jesus coming for For all I know the earth is spinning slow Suns at half mast cause masses ain't aglow On bended knee, prostrate before an altered tree I've made the forest suit me Tables and chairs Papers and prayers Matter versus spirit A metal ladder A wooden cross A plastic bottle of water A mandala encased in glass A spirit encased in flesh Sound from shaped hollows The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion A man that cries in his sleep A truth that has gone out of fashion A mode of expression A paint splattered wall A carton of cigarettes A bouquet of corpses A dying forest A nurtured garden A privatized prison A candle with a broken wick A puddle that reflects the sun A piece of paper with my name on it I'm surrounded I surrender All All that I am I have been All I have been has been a long time coming I am becoming all that I am The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute Unheard, yet felt A gathered wetness A quiet moisture Sound trapped in a bubble Released into wind Wind fellows and land merchants We are history's detergent Water soluble, light particles, articles of cleansing breath Articles amending death These words are not tools of communication They are shards of metal Dropped from eight story windows They are waterfalls and gas leaks Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf The tools of a trade Barter's bard, barb of barters Catch phrases and misunderstandings But they are not what I feel when I am alone Surrounded by everything and nothing And there isn't a word or phrase to be caught A verse to be recited A mantra to fill my being in those moments I am blankness, the contained center of an ""O"" The pyramidic containment of an ""A"" I stand in the middle of all that I have learned All that I have memorized All that I've known by heart Unable to reach any of it There is no sadness There is no bliss It is a forgotten memory A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking There, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness But then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas Like dead rats held by their tails So as not to infect this newly oiled skin I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal I can think of nothing less likely to fly There are no wings more weighted I too have felt a heaviness The stare of man guessing at my being Yes I am homeless A homeless man making offerings to the after-future Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles A nation unified in exhale A cloud of smoke A native pipe ceremony All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps Snow covered mountains Lipsticks smeared and shriveled Offerings to an afterworld Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me I have seeded a forest of myself Little books from tall trees It matters not what this paper be made of Give me notebooks made of human flesh Dried on steel hooks and nooses Make uses of use, uses of us It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me I have seeded a forest of myself Little books from tall trees On bended knee Prostrate before an altered tree I've made the forest suit me Tables and chairs

Like the world's interrupting my song, with an interlude Can't y'all see I'm busy trying to balance out my chemical? Finishing up, what y'all ain't even begin to do When your back's against the ropes it's either him or you Y'all ain't so important that my words are meant for you When did ey'body become so sensual Caught up in the he-say, she-say, blog sites Him and her, broke up, WorldStar, Nahright Dumb fans, they believe, everything that y'all write Found out, friends fake, couldn't even facade right Pressures on, won't fail, nigga got too much to prove Would've been, lost it, but I got too much to lose Say what you want about Joe, but I stood my ground Bitch, I get it up myself, you just put it down They say, I put my whole life on display to my dismay Stop it, you're carrying on without logic Let me tell you this about Joe I only say what I want you to hear You'll only see what I want to show Crushing up the Percocet, chasing the high, Talli I couldn't make this shit up if I tried The forecast shows a downpour Y'all just made God cry, praying for my Downfall  This shit I'm talking 'bout right here Let me tell you niggas something You can be anything in this world that you want Except for my downfall   I'm a victim of society, circumstance or just feelings Was a nigga victimized? Or just willing? No blinds, no bags, just dealing No foundation or floor plan, just building Check it, nights bright, but the days dark Covered in tattoos, but hate art These eggshells I walk on are razor sharp Staring at the finish line, looking for a way to start I've been called everything, an extremist Is that a bad thing or what they really mean is Anything a nigga do, a nigga mean it And I won't let a person, place or thing come between it An opportunist is how they paint me But if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me? Still I feel like my problems are great Shit, if I don't never solve em' I'm straight On the bright side God choose me to put a lot on my plate So he had to figure I wouldn't be bothered by the weight I'm trying to change the pattern but it's on loop Even an outcast in my own group What's it mean when ey'body standing next to you expects of you Everything that comes wit a spectacle? If everywhere I go, I just leave behind residue Tell me, trust me, I won't think nothing less of you  I'm sorry I ain't around more Come up with me, or stay on the ground floor I don't need shelter from the downpour Y'all can be whatever you want, just not my downfall They tryna make me slow, tryna take me, no! Can't be my downfall They tryna knock my grind, I won't stop, I'm fine Can't be my downfall   No moment of clarity The next fight showing is a rarity Severity in me against my growin popularity Rappers won't rap, I'm forced to believe they scared of me But can no longer use the scape goat, 'They not aware of me' So y'all can go and throw your little pot shots Some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot I'm getting my head right, recollecting Y'all looking for some website resurrection Being that I got too much to lose Or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that I'm accused No longer amused, affected my loved ones Now they startin' to bruise And I don't want no parts of that abuse Wouldn't wish upon my worst foe, a day in my shoes That'll just eliminate any excuse And why entertain em'? Old me would'a lost my senses, y'all just helping the new me regain em' Been punched in the face It was either feed my family or hunt wit the .38 I ain't want brunch to wait I've out grown Hip-Hop, it turned into a Day-Care So next time some shit is on my mind, it'll stay there I'm staring at the man in the mirror But it ain't helping see the man any clearer So I get M.I.A from around y'all Till God stops answering these prayers for my downfall    Tell me what am I to do If I ain't have a soul a nigga always had you, pardon due But I gotta speak candidly How the FUCK could you abandon me?!? Wit 5 years of blood, sweat and tears But it was obviously a disconnect We turned that into a disrespect Said she been holding it inside for years, she's unhappy So the girl I wan' marry was afraid to come and tap me So I went away on tour, and you went on one of your own But while you was on the horn all day wit ol' boy Did you ever think about what it would do to your home? What's his name? Where's he live? What is it he offers? What's he got to give? And I love you so much that when I caught on to your fibs I hit you like a man, you wore it in your ribs I was heated But had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see what's underneath it Come to find out you felt lied to and cheated Mistreated, and kept it a big secret Or are you just loose? And I'm so naive I'm tryna give you an excuse Now that I refuse to believe, we life partners Holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us Can't use anything I ever gave you to bury me You supposed to be the one to bury me You wan' leave?

And runnin' from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated  Lady, don't you know we love ya?

(Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?   Pour out some liquor and I reminisce 'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated  Lady, don't you know we love ya?

Dance with the Devil,rap,Immortal Technique,2001.0,1169615.0,{},"   I once knew a nigga whose real name was William His primary concern was makin' a million Bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams A corrupted young mind at the age of 13 Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder He started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects He was fascinated by material objects But he understood money never bought respect He built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal I don't project my insecurities on other people He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed Dancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed But he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed  Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot   So Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew Startin' fights over little shit up on the block Stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock Workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot Hit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine Fulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain Tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love They told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die Standin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes Billy realized that these men were well-guarded And they wanted to test him before business started Suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted So now he had a choice between goin' back to his life Or makin' money with made men up in the cyph' His dreams about cars and ice made him agree A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three  Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot   They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin' Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone Three in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home And so they quietly got out the car and followed her Walkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her They wrapped her shirt around her head And knocked her onto the floor ""This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw"" So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground Screamin', ""Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!"" The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin' They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin' Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently And then they all proceeded to rape her violently Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn Rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned When they were done and she was lyin' Bloody, broken and bruised One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22 They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head  I'm fallin' and I can't turn back I'm fallin' and I can't turn back   Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice And he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter 'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother She looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her She cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate His corruption had successfully changed his fate And he remembered how his mom used to come home late Workin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth? He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth And cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared But only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true 'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows And every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow He could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked White, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever     Oh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?

Poet Laureate II,rap,Canibus,2003.0,53451.0,{}," Uh, I don’t understand how a writer would ever get writer’s block, so-called. My problem is having too much and being unable to get it down   Yo, why is the Ripper so ill? That would be an unpardonable breach of confidence for me to reveal He said, ""One of these days, all eyes would be on me When they look up in the sky and see the neon C"" Rhymes inscribed on a nickel disk encased In glass with an ion beam for longevity For more than ten centuries, impressions and memories The first time-machine inventor will mention me Canibus was a visionary indeed He believed light could travel in multiples of c The organic supercomputer that solved the mysteries of Klein Kaluza with two blue metric rulers Liked Cool J, but thought Stephen Jay Gould was cooler And he never liked to propagate rumors Smoked Canary Island cigars Liked American luxury cars and beautiful Asian broads He had a strong mind, he used to philosophize About rhymes while he was pruning his bonsai He claimed that he had written the greatest rhyme of all time But he would never take it out his archives He wrote two songs per day And was constantly experimenting with his wordplay In his youth he did a report on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey He got an F but he deserved an A I followed his career from the first day It seemed a lack of support contributed to his inert ways I seen him pull in twenty-four hour workdays With deferred pay, undeterred by the word ""shame"" Public humiliation was the worst pain He was spinning out of control like a Class 5 hurricane He said he wouldn't want another MC to suffer the same Especially when there's nothing to gain He was the illest alive but nobody would face it He spit till his tongue was too torched to taste it Privately funded corporations carbon dated his latest creations To extract the information They found it utterly amazing They claimed the body of his work was the same thing as a priceless painting Never mattered to him that art galleries hated him 'Cause Thomas Kinkade called and said he would take ten Complete enigmas wrapped in puzzles encrypted in language With sound but without shape or signature Kept files in his garage on MS-DOS In a fire-proof pod, we thought it was odd Outside there was a shed with an Oppenheimer lock He apparently kept more wax than Madame Tussaud's We were in total awe 'cause it blew our minds So many rhymes that were intricately designed He was Poet Laureate of his time And if you don't mind, I'd like to share some of his rhymes Alone in my room looking through the 32X telescope zoom Adjusting the focus of the moon One should not assume the philosophy of David Hume Is nothing more then a subjective conclusion What is the maximum field rate application? The runaway glaciation surrounding the ocean basin Affects the population fluctuation On a continuous basis but that's just the basics The juxtaposition of Canibus' position The precision of something no other has written Way above and beyond what was intended The unparalleled malleable enunciation of a sentence You didn't go to college obviously I can tell by your ungodly unintelligible terminology A remarkable odyssey, the rhymes of modern speeds When the brain orders the body not to breathe Your competency is not up to speed, you're not in my league You couldn't possibly be hotter then me Or oppositely your minus twenty-five degrees You'd squeeze but the condensation makes rifle barrels freeze Allow me to speak figuratively, nigga please My intellectual properties are about the size of Greece Your counselor advised you not to speak My counselor advised me to keep rhyming until they stopped the beat In the words of Joseph Heller, ""I learned how to write better Even though it sort of irked me"" He said he didn't understand the process of the imagination But he felt he was at its mercy Which explains my point perfectly and certainly reinforces The reason why nobody's probably ever heard of me Couldn't understand what I mean by ill Unless you try to translate what I print to film This is the line, the reel, the circle of time The cycle of eternity, the emergence of one line Academic phonetics render critics tongue-tied And personifies dry humor of cum laude alumni A wise man sees failure as progress A fool divorces his knowledge and misses the logic And loses his soul in the process Obsessed with nonsense with a caricature that has no content My style is masterful, multilateral I could battle a fool and be naturally cruel Words of scorn are a disastrous tool From an existentialist's view I'm a better rapper than you Grab the mic and rip your physical fabric in two My attitude is fucked up but admirable Different methods interpreted into different forms From entirely different perceptions and seen from different norms Not just spitting a poem, there’s much more involved There's much more pieces of the puzzle for you to solve Forty-eight orders of mechanical laws And rays of creational cause enhance the cadence of my bars Maybe I am self-absorbed But that's the effect, to find the cause you should ask my A&R Today is what it is, but only because yesterday was what it was Permitting you heard of Beelzebub A tale of demons and drugs, pissy drunk in the club With the DJ doing the needle rub Chances are you'll never see me son Yeah I know my name's Canibus but I can't help you if you need a dub I came to holla at some big booty bitches and listen to the speakers thump Where you get conceited from? I'm so nice on the mic they wanna beat me up It's deep as fuck, I ain't seen it all but I've seen enough Really unbelievable stuff There's a lot of times when I want to speak but I'm stuck I should leave this rap shit alone And kick my incredible rhymes in the privacy of my own home My imagination is my own The liberty to speak to freely lyrically on the microphone With a pen in my hand, I bring motion to the Enneagram And become ""Can-I Millenium Man"" Engrave my back with the emperor's stamp Been spitting scientific rap since the 17th century began Trying to escape the wicked empire of Def Jam And the land where lyrics are bland and heretics hang Every warrior has an axe to bury But he has to learn to discern between enemy and adversary I said to myself, ""Germaine, this is insane It's suicide, it's controlled flight into terrain"" I fought to regain control of the plane, but went up in a ball of flames And got banned from the Hip-Hop hall of fame For two bars I kept hearing in my head Over and over again, it cost me everything I'm convinced now that more than the truth is at stake Where people create language that pretends to communicate Euphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes But its a byproduct of the ghetto music we make From an extroverted point of view I think its too late Hip Hop has never been the same since '88 Since it became a lucrative profession There's a misconception that a movement in any direction is progression Even though the potency of it lessens Big money industries writing checks to suppress the question And nobody gives a fuck no more, no one goes to the book store Ever since the confluence of Moore's Law But I stay in the lab like Niels Bohr and his son Aage Edward Lorenz and Leo Szilard Lyrically I took rap music and turned the knob To the right full throttle and added panache Why would I argue with my own conscience over the truth? That's like me telling myself, ""Don't tell me what to do"" Dialyses and analyses of battle MCs Sometimes I say things I myself can't believe My lyrical is so skillfully elliptical I can understand how it makes you miserable You wonder why I never let you play your beats for me Or why I keep my studio enshrouded in secrecy You wonder what's my infatuation with Alicia Keys ""Canibus why don't you speak to me?"" Yo, I meant it when I said no one can shine on a song that features me That's why I said it so vehemently You need to replace the hate with respect I'm probably the best yet, Poet Laureate  Generally I take… I go with the given, you know, with what comes ta me over, the celestial wireless… Whenever it comes.

I wish another day would come and bring the sun in tow Cause this storm's a raging ocean and I'm sucked in by the undertow The thunder throws a frightening blow, the lighting glows and disappears It appears, that it'll be days before the fog and mist will clear Sticks and logs and missiles here, watch that they don't take a Eye out, cry out - and get drowned out by mother nature, nature uh  Ignore the storm clouds gatherin' on the coast And not give into emotion, be strong, keep on Running  ",22615.0

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay."" Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with  So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you?  And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""  No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""    I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer    I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""  And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""    And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said    ""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""    And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...    ...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...    ...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX    And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""    ""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""    You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""    That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...    I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up    Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad    Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""    Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'  ""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow I got 11 plaques on my walls right now You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""  Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""    ""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""    Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""    ""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""    And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""  So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you? So won't you raise your glass, won't you?",910.0
